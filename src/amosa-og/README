 We are at:
 sriparna_r@isical.ac.in/sanghami@isical.ac.in/  

Compilation procedure:--> gcc -lm amosa_real.c -o amosa

Run the program as:
     ./amosa problem 

For eg. if you want to run ZDT1 function then write in the terminal as ./amosa ZDT1
    OR  if you want to run DTLZ110 function then write in the terminal as ./amosa DTLZ110

The Output functional values will be in "saplot.out".

To plot the curve of Pareto Optimal font, Here is the steps

Step 1: Open terminal

	Step 2: Type gnuplot
		
		Step 3: Type plot "saplot.out"
